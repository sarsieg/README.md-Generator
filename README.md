## Description
This project creates a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input. As every project needs a professional README.md file to showcase the information and instructions to their web application this project was made to help any web developer or user create files within a terminal using prompts to generate the answers of the questions asked. My motivation was to show the power of a generator and help people create files faster and more efficiently.

## Installation
You must first run npm install in order to install the following npm package dependencies as specified in the package.json, as well as inquirer that will prompt you for inputs. The application can be invoked with node index.js.

## Usage
When you run node index.js that application uses the inquirer package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions about your GitHub account and your project.

The application will generate markdown and a table of contents for the README.md conditionally based on the users responses to the inquirer prompts. The README.md will also include bages for your GitHub repo as well as your GitHub profile and email.
